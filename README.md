CA Housing EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization project using Python to analyze housing data and uncover patterns in pricing, lot characteristics, and categorical features.

Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a housing dataset using Python data science tools. The notebook focuses on cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing numerical and categorical variables to understand how different housing features relate to sale prices.

The goal is to demonstrate practical EDA skills used in real-world data analysis, including statistical summaries, correlations, and visual storytelling.

Key Objectives

Inspect dataset structure and missing values

Analyze distribution of housing prices

Explore relationships between lot size and sale price

Compare categorical features with price trends

Create pivot tables and heatmaps for deeper insight

Use advanced visualizations to reveal patterns

Dataset

The dataset contains housing records with numerical and categorical features such as:

Sale Price

Lot Area

Sale Condition

Lot Shape

Property attributes

The notebook explores how these variables interact and influence pricing.
